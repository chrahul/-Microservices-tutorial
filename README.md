## Mastering Microservices: A Journey from Monolith to Distributed Systems

Welcome to **Mastering Microservices: A Journey from Monolith to Distributed Systems**! In this talk, I will be sharing my journey and real-world experiences in designing **Cloud Native Microservices Architectures**, leveraging **DevOps** practices, and evolving software systems from **monolithic architectures** to **event-driven microservices**.

This repository contains the materials and architectural designs discussed during the talk, offering practical insights into how microservices can scale, enhance resilience, and drive performance in distributed systems.

## **Overview**

Throughout the talk, I will explore key design patterns, principles, and best practices for building and evolving modern architectures. This is not just a theoretical sessionâ€”it's a **hands-on, practical guide** based on my experience working with **cloud-native**, **DevOps-driven architectures**.

### Topics Covered:
- **What are Microservices?**: Key concepts, monolithic vs microservices.
- **Designing Microservices**: Principles like Single Responsibility, Domain-Driven Design, and Bounded Context.
- **Building Microservices**: Communication strategies, REST APIs, gRPC, event-driven architectures.
- **Securing Microservices**: OAuth2, mTLS, API Gateway security.
- **Microservices Deployment**: CI/CD pipelines, containerization, Kubernetes orchestration.
- **Scaling Microservices**: Horizontal scaling, load balancing, and fault tolerance.
- **Advanced Topics**: Event-driven microservices, serverless architecture, and service mesh.
