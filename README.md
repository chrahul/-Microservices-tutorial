## Mastering Microservices: A Journey from Monolith to Distributed Systems

Welcome to the Microservices Architecture Design! 

Here, we are going to explore designing microservices architecture using industry-recognized design patterns, principles, and best practices. Starting from a basic monolithic architecture, we progressively evolve to event-driven microservices and serverless microservices architectures. 

I'll take a hands-on approach, ensuring practical learning with real-world patterns to design scalable, resilient, and highly available systems.
